# VimConfiguration

## Installing Vim

### OS X

In Mac OS, simply installing with Homebrew is the best.

- $ brew update
- $ brew install vim

### Ubuntu

In Debian or Ubuntu, according to my experience, the best way is to remove Vim and compile with Python(or other language) support, otherwise you will face difficulties in autocomplete features.

I followed this [Wiki](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source)

## Extensions

I installed Vim Plugins with the help of [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).

And I followed this [blog](https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/) for the choice of Plugins.

## Vimrc File

I have my vimrc file in this Repo.
